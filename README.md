# yao-ry-Chinese-word-probability

A very simple script to extract Chinese word (token) probabilities based on bert-base-Chinese (inference API: https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-chinese)

A Chinese word always contains more than one token, so I also played with the script that can extract the probabilities of the next several tokens.
